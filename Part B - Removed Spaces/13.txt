thought it was "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
in Germanworse than my own:--

"There is no carriage here. The Herr is not expected after all. He will
now come on to Bukovina,and return to-morrow or the next day; better
thenext day." Whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and
snort and plunge wildly, so that the driver had to hold them up. Then,
amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
of themselves, a cal√®che, with four horses, drove up behind us,overtook
us, and drew up beside thecoach. I could see from the flash of our
lamps, as the rays fellon them, that the horses were coal-black and
splendid animals. They were driven by a tall man, with a long brown
beard and a great black hat,which seemed to hide his face from us. I
could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
in the lamplight, as he turned to us. He said to the driver:--

"You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--

"The English Herr was in a hurry," towhich the stranger replied:--

"That is why, I suppose, you wished him togo on to Bukovina. You cannot
deceive me, my friend; I knowtoo much, and my horses are swift." As he
spoke he smiled, and the lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
very red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as whiteas ivory. One of my
companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--

    "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--
    ("For the dead travel fast.")
