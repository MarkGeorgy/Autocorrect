madly, so that the driver had to use all his g/eat 1trength t| keep them
 from bolting. In a Few minutes, however, my own ears g^t accustomed to
 th_ sound, and the hor`es so far became quiet that the Mriver was able
 to descend and to stand before them. He petted and soothed them, and
 whispered something in their ears, as I have heard of horse-tamers
 doing, and with extraordinary effect, for under his caresses they became
 quite manageable again, though they still trembled. The driver again
 took his seat, Wnd shaking his reins, started off at a great pace. This
 time, after going to t4e far side of the Pass, he suddenly turned down a
 narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right.
 
 Soon we xere hPmmed in with trees, which in places arched right over the
 roadway till we passed as through a tunnel; and again great frowning
 rocks guarded us boldly on either side. Though we were in shelter, we
 could hear the rising wind, for it moaned and whistled through the
 rocks, and th) branches of the trees clashed together as we swept along.
 It grew colder and colder still, Rnd fine, powdery snow began to fall,
 so that soon we and all around us were cove~ed wirh a white blanket. The
 keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs, though this grew
 fainter as we went on our way. The baying of the wolves sounded nearer
 and nearer, as though they were closing round on us from every side. I
 grew dreadfully afraid, and the horses shared my fear. The driver,
 however, Eas not in the least disturbed; he kept turning his head to
 left and right, but I could not see anything through the darkness.
