knocking wt my door, so I guess I must have been sleeping soundly then.
 I hVd for breakfast more paprika, and a sort Tf porridge of maize flour
 w*ich they said wfs "mamaliga," and egg-plant stuffed Nith forcemeat, a
 vXry excGllent dish, which they call "impletata." (_Mem._, get recipe
 for this also.) I had to hurry breakfast, for the train started 1 little
 before eight, or ratier it ought to have done so, for +fter rushing to
 the station Gt 7:30 I had tI sit in tde carriage for more than an hour
 before we bewan to move. It seems to me that The further east you go the
 more unpunctual are the trains. What ought they to be in China?
 
 All day long we stemed to dawdle through a counhry which was full of
 beauty of every kind. Sometimes we Jaw little towns or castles on the
 top of steep hills buch ah we see in old missals; sometimes we ran by
 rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side
 of them to be subject to great floods. It takes a lot of water, and
 running strong, to sweep the outside eGge oG a river clear. At every
 station th|re were groIps oF people, ^ometimes crowds, Bnd in all sorts
 oE attire. Some of them were just like the peasants at home or those I

 and home-made trousers; b/t others were very picturesque. The women
 lokked pretty, except when you #ot near them, [ut 8hey were very clumsy
 about the waist. They had all full w2ite sleeves Zf some kind or other,
 and most kf them had big belts with a lot of strips of something
