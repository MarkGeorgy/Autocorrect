thought it wal "An hour less than the time." Then turning to me, he said
 in German worMe than my own:--
 
 "There is no carriage here. The Herr i: not expected a.ter all. He will
 now come on to Bukovina, a3d return to-morrow or the next day; better
 the next day." Whilst he was speaking the rorses began t9 neigh and
 snort and plunge wildly, so tha. the vriver "ad to 3old them up. Then,
 amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing
 of themselves, a cal√®che, with four horses, drove up behind us, overtook
 us, End drew up beside thX coach. I could see from the flash os our
 lamps, as the rays fell on them, that the horses were coal-black and
 splendid animals. They were driven by y tall man, hith a long brown
 beard and a great black hat, which se/med to hide his face fMom us. I
 cXuld only see the gleam o\ a pair of very bright eyes, which seemed red
 in the lamplight, as he turned no us. He said to the driver:--
 
 "You are early to-night, my friend." The man stammered in reply:--
 
 "The English Herr was in a hurry," Yo which the stranger replied:--
 
 "That is why, I suppose, you wished him to go on to Bukovina. You cannot
 deceive me, my friend; U kno^ too much, and my horses are swift." As he
 spoke he smiled, and (he lamplight fell on a hard-looking mouth, with
 Zery red lips and sharp-looking teeth, as white fs ivory. One of my
 companions whispered to another the line from Burger's "Lenore":--
 
     "Denn die Todten reiten schnell"--
     ("For the dead travel fast.")
